Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on sentiment analysis for airline-related tweets using the RoBERTa model. The goal is to classify tweets into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments while addressing challenges like informal language, slang, and class imbalance.

Features

Dataset: Uses the Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset (~15,000 tweets).
Preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenization, and handling of class imbalance.
Model: Fine-tuned RoBERTa, compared against Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes.
Evaluation: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Accuracy metrics.
Explainability: Integrated SHAP analysis for understanding model decisions.
Results

RoBERTa demonstrated superior performance:

Accuracy: 84.3%
F1-Score: 85.2%
